# update-notifier
Script to check for pacman and yaourt updates and notify user about it. Can be called with conky, autostart script or cron.

This script will notify the user as soon as updates are available. It uses the "notify-send" command to do this. If you want to test, whether it can work on your system, execute this command in your terminal:
